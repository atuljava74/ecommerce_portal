# Ecommerce Portal

A Flutter-based ecommerce portal that provides a seamless shopping experience with a modern UI, integrated with a backend for managing products, cart, and orders. The app is built using the BLoC pattern to separate business logic from the UI, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

###Architecture
The app follows a Layered Architecture using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) Pattern:

Presentation Layer: UI components managed by Flutter widgets (screens/ and widgets/ folders).
Business Logic Layer: BLoC classes handle business logic and state management (blocs/ folder).
Data Layer: Models and utility classes that represent and manipulate data (models/ and utils/ folders).
This architecture ensures separation of concerns, making the app more scalable and easier to maintain.

###Features
User Authentication: Login and Signup functionality with secure session management.
Product Catalog: Browse products by category and subcategory, with detailed product descriptions and images.
Cart Management: Add products to the cart, manage quantities, and view cart totals.
Checkout Process: Seamless checkout with shipping information, payment method selection, and order confirmation.
Order History: View past orders with detailed information on each purchase.
Responsive UI: Beautifully designed UI.
